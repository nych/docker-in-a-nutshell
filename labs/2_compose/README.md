# Docker Compose Lab
This lab contains different parts which must be solved. The resulting artifacts (Dockerfiles, Scripts, Sourcefiles, etc.) can be stored in this directory. For this excercise use the compose demo you can find at ../demos/compose-demo.
## Part 1
Use the Docker CLI to start up the compose-demo application in a way, that your terminal is not blocked by the log output. If you have achieved that, make sure that everything is fine by checking the logs of all services individually.
## Part 2
Extend the app service with a route "/" which should return a list of routes/endpoints our service provides. If you are done, deploy your change.
## Part 3 (Bonus)
Try to init the compose-demo service without using the commands provided by the compose plugin. You can wrap the necessary commands into a bash script.
